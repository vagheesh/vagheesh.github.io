A single human zygote contains all the necessary information to develop into a complete human being and simultaneously carries within it the evolutionary history of our species. Our lab works at the interface of genetics, computer science and statistics and works on genomic information theory. We seek to understand the genetic basis of disease as well as understand human evolution.


We are recruiting! Find out more about [joining the lab](/join/).
